# EPQTestingNotWorking
I was trying to add this SQLiteDatabasing from this guys videos (see videos 8-11) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKuM3cHO7G8&index=9&list=PL_PaSTBkUwk4PXlhZIe4COpwnWeCRnw2F

However, when I add homework tasks in 'homework.xml' after I have made the SQLite database, when I close the appliation, the tasks are removed, and are not saved. How do I get it so the tasks are saved and are permament?
